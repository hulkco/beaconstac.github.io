**<a name="1"></a>1. How to find out beacon health status and battery level?**

It’s easy - just login to your account on the Beaconstac iPhone or Android app. Next, navigate to Home -> My Beacons; here, you need to select a Beacon whose health and battery level you would like to know. Scroll down and you will see battery level, other hardware-related info along with the last updated time.

Also, if you would like to modify Transmit Power and Advertising Interval, you can do so by going close to a beacon and tapping ‘Edit’.

**<a name="2"></a>2. Can I send lock-screen notifications to my users?**
As long as the app is installed on your users device, you can send lock-screen notifications. Beaconstac SDK leverages iOS 8’s Core Location framework and is capable of sending notification even when the app is not running in the background.
