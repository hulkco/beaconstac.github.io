##Using analytics to gain customer insight

Let’s say you have a retail network with 10 stores and 10 beacons at each store. Let’s assume that you have tagged the beacons correctly and have campaigns set up for your network.

The first chart that you will see on the analytics overview is the beacon activity chart. This chart, shows you the top five beacons that your visitors registered. We’d expect these to be the beacons placed at the entrance to your most well-trafficked stores.

You can change the “dimension” of the chart from camp-on (which is the act of the visitor’s phone registering a beacon) to ‘Rules'(number of times rules were triggered by that beacon), ‘Average time spent’ (average time spent by visitors in the proximity of that beacon) and ‘Total time spent’ (total time spent by visitors in the proximity of that beacon). The beacons may change in order or even change completely as you change the dimension.

The next chart that you will see on the overview is the rules performance chart. This shows your 5 most popular campaigns and the number of times each of these were triggered.

The default time range for the charts is 1 month. You can change this from the range selector.

####Visitor analytics

The visitor analytics page shows a list of visitors who visited your stores. As an overview, you can see their name (depending on the permissions your app has taken from them to collect this information), their last visited store location, their last visit, the number of visits, their Beaconstac sdk version and their device profile. the default time period for this list is 1 month. You can change the date range using the selector.

Below this list you will find a handy pie chart showing the number of new visitors and the number of returning visitors in that time period.

####Detailed visitor analytics

When you click on the name of a visitor in the list of visitors, you will be taken to a detailed visitor analytics page which will give you a snapshot of that particular visitor: name, profile (from custom attributes used in campaigns through the app), device ID, total visits and last visit.

Below that, you will find a pie-chart showing the time that visitor spent most in the proximity of certain beacons.

And below that, you will find the details of the last ten visits made by that visitor to your stores. Details include specific beacons and the timestamp, so you can easily extrapolate the path that the visitor took inside your retail space.
