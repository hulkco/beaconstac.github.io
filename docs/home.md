Beaconstac is a technology stack for running proximity marketing campaigns. It includes:
## iBeacon and Eddystone certified Beacon hardware
## iOS and Android SDKs
## Cloud-based campaign manager

### Beaconstac App

Beaconstac is like Mixpanel for indoor marketing and makes it super easy for marketers to run personalised campaigns for their target audience. Beaconstac offers everything that is needed for brands building mobile apps whether for continuous customer engagement or for bringing in more footfalls.

Beacon hardware
Our Beacon Starter Kit is a set of three AA-battery powered Beacons that are iBeacon compliant, password-secured and last over 4 years. Beacons are handy devices (about 2.5 inch each side) that can be placed anywhere.

A Beacon is like a lighthouse that continuously emits identifier information (major number, minor number, UUID) to nearby devices like an iPhone. Itâ€™s easy to locate a user whenever their smartphone starts receiving BLE signals.

SDKs
Once integrated, Beaconstac SDKs make existing or new iOS and Android apps context-aware. SDKs enable proximity marketing and location analytics through an iBeacon-compliant BLE network.

If you need any help with adding Beaconstac SDK to your app, jump right into our tutorials or SDK references.

Campaign Manager
Our cloud-based web solution allows marketers to manage marketing campaigns. You can easily create rules and tags to target a specific audience.

Beaconstac App
Beaconstac App on both Android and iOS allows smartphone users to configure beacons in their vicinity. Users can change settings like transmission power, advertising interval and read critical data like battery status, distance between them and the beacons.

Once you start using Beaconstac, you will find certain terms that are consistent all across - be it Beaconstac App, SDKs or Dashboard. Here are the building blocks of Beaconstac:

Beacons
Beacon object is an identifier for hardware beacons - you can name your beacons or use a UUID in combination with Major and Minor numbers. All Beaconstac beacons are protected by a password.

A UUID contains 36 characters including 4 hyphens and is primarily meant for finding out official device manufacturer.
A Major value defines a sub-region within a larger region defined by the UUID.
A Minor value defines a further subdivision within a larger region defined by the UUID and major values.

Rules
A Rule allows you to define a set of conditions that must be satisfied in order to trigger notifications.
